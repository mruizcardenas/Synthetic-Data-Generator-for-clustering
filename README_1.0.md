# Synthetic-Data-Generator-for-clustering
In this repository you can find a data generator to test clustering methods. The generator are coded in R.

Using this script you can generate light datasets where are present group patterns for clustering algorithm testing.
You can tune parameters like the number of instances, number of variables and noise individually for each subgroup.

You can simulate the existence of two subgroups and instance in the intersection of the groups. Parameters are
explained in the script and you can contact me at mruizcardenas.math@gmail.com for any question.
